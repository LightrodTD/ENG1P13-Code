# ENG1P13-Code
This repository consist of all my computing labs completed in the course ENG 1P13. 
The purpose of this course was to familiarize students with the basics of programming. Certains weeks would be dedicated to a certain topic, with assignments to submit a day after the lab. 
NOTE: By no means are the solutions provided the ONLY way of solving the problem. These files are my work, and how I would approach said problem.

These labs go over concepts in programming such as:
- Functions
- Loops
- String Manipulation
- File I/O
- Logic Operators
- Nested Structure
- Test Plans
- Algorithms
- Exception Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming
